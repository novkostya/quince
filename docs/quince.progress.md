# quince — progress dashboard

**One-line state.** **qn.0 is BUILT — the floor stands.** `make gates` + `make image`
are green from a fresh tree inside `quince-dev`, the image runs (`quince version`,
`/api/health` → ok, `quince-vault selftest` exit 0, embedded UI serves), and the repo is
`git init`'d (not yet committed — awaiting Operator). **The frontier is now `qn.1`
(core daemon skeleton + demo mode + UI shell).** Spec: [`specs/qn.1/qn.1.md`](specs/qn.1/qn.1.md) (to be written).

| Rung | Title | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| qn.0 | Floor: scaffold, gates, CI, image | **done** — gates + image green in quince-dev (2026-07-19) |
| qn.1 | Core daemon skeleton + demo mode + UI shell | **frontier** — spec ready |
| qn.2 | muxd client + live device table | outlined in roadmap |
| qn.3 | Device ops + Devices page | outlined |
| qn.4 | Backup engine, both transports + headless CLI | outlined |
| qn.5 | Storage backends (zfs snapshot-native / hardlink / copy) + reconciliation | outlined |
| qn.6 | v0.1 release shape (after qn.7) | outlined |
| qn.7 | Wi-Fi reliability hardening (before v0.1) | outlined |
| qn.8 | Vault: unlock, lazy browse, conformance suite | outlined |
| qn.9–10 | Domain viewers (overview / messages) | outlined |
| qn.11 | Photos viewer | **parked, lowest priority** (icloudpd+Immich cover photos; Apple-thumbnails spike first if revived) |
| qn.12 | PWA + push + schedules | outlined |

**Open questions for the Operator** (tracked here until resolved):
1. **`usbmuxd` daemon provisioning** (`PROPOSED (gap)` in stack D2, found in qn.0): Alpine
   has no `usbmuxd` daemon package, so "the container ships usbmuxd" can't be `apk`'d.
   Ruling needed before qn.2 — (A) source-build the daemon in a Dockerfile stage, or
   (B) bind-mount the host's usbmuxd socket (compose.lab.yml already shows B). qn.0 ships
   only the CLIs + `libusbmuxd` client and builds on neither.

*Resolved:* **project name = quince** (Operator, 2026-07-18, after due diligence — see
decisions log (y); repo `github.com/novkostya/quince`, images
`ghcr.io/novkostya/quince`, binaries `quince` / `quince-vault`, rung prefix `qn.`).
License = MIT. `@mercury-fx/ui` = not consumed; mainstream vendored-component stack
instead (decisions log (u)). GitHub owner = `github.com/novkostya` (org transfer only
on real traction).

**Decisions log.**
- 2026-07-18: full planning pass (this docs set) from the feasibility lab
  (`../chatgpt-original-idea-chat.md`); Go core + Python vault + React/mercury-style UI;
  USB primary / Wi-Fi experimental; ZFS first-class with hardlink portable fallback.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator review): (a) vault seam made explicitly swappable — a future
  all-Go vault is a drop-in behind `vault.Vault` + the conformance suite; (b) host
  auto-snapshot tooling rejected — quince relies only on snapshots it creates; (c) the
  never-mutate-latest layout (`versions/` + `latest` + `work/`) adopted — dataset is
  crash/replication-consistent at any instant (sanoid/syncoid-safe), rollback machinery
  deleted; (d) persistent backup-content indexing rejected in favor of lazy
  session-scoped reads; sole exception = fingerprint-validated derived caches
  (thumbnails, qn.11). Side effect of (d): no secrets at rest in v1.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator review 2): (e) photos parked at lowest priority — Operator's photo
  pipeline is icloudpd + Immich; if revived, spike Apple's prebuilt in-backup thumbnails
  (`Media/PhotoData/Thumbnails`) before any generation/cache machinery — likely moots the
  derived-cache exception entirely; (f) operations UX fixed as a core value (stack D12):
  Plex-grade setup (compose up → onboard in UI, everything configurable in-app) with
  OpenWrt/PVE-grade config — one tidy hand-editable `config.yml` as source of truth,
  atomic validated writes, no secrets in it, UI is an editor over the file.
- 2026-07-18 (external crosscheck review, `../chatgpt-planning-crosscheck-feedback.md`,
  adjudicated with the Operator): **Operator rulings** — (g) zfs backend is
  snapshot-native (in-place `current/`, versions = quince's own snapshots, no hardlinks
  under ZFS; consistency guarantee restated per-backend: on zfs it lives in the
  snapshots, the head is a working buffer); (h) Wi-Fi is the PRIMARY use case —
  first-class transport from qn.4, hardening rung (qn.7) moved BEFORE v0.1, experimental
  flag removed (rejects the crosscheck's Wi-Fi demotion). **Crosscheck adopted** —
  journaled commit + first-class startup reconciliation with on-disk
  `quince-version.json` markers; two-level verification (structural at commit, content
  canary at next unlock); vault RPC hardening (framed `initialize`, `materialize` with
  opaque handles — no paths cross the boundary, scratch-jailed vault); web security
  baseline pulled into qn.1 + audit trail + tmpfs scratch honesty; hardened deployment
  profile (muxd split) as a qn.6 compose example; domain APIs envelope-frozen only,
  fields after research spikes; D12 config staged (core in qn.1, live-reload/comments in
  qn.6); headless CLI added to qn.4; destructive hardlink-safety matrix replaces the
  single-file inode check. **Crosscheck rejected** — per-version/clone ZFS datasets
  (don't propagate into container bind mounts; fragile hook chains), CLI-first roadmap
  restructure (parallel tracks already decouple UI; CLI lands inside qn.4), Wi-Fi
  demotion (see h).
- 2026-07-18 (Operator clarification, second pass): the offsite model is **whole-tree
  file-level sync** — one rclone job over the entire storage parent (e.g.
  `/rpool/userdata`), walking live mounts; per-dataset `.zfs` paths don't fit it. Design
  restated as D5a: each zfs device dataset holds `current/` (in-place working copy,
  excluded by one static rclone filter) + `latest/` (verified mirror rebuilt at commit —
  reflink clone preferred, probed fallbacks hardlink/copy — atomic swap); flow =
  `zfs snapshot -r && rclone sync /rpool/userdata b2:…`, remote history via B2
  versioning/`--backup-dir`. **Operator ruling: one child dataset per device**
  (independent snapshot streams; snapshot list = version list), so the constrained hook
  gains `zfs create` scoped to children of the parent; dataset destroy stays
  human-only. PVE bind-mount propagation gotcha (new child = empty stub in a running
  LXC) handled by probe + printed `pct set` instructions; Docker via `:rshared`;
  single-dataset fallback mode documented.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator Q&A, third pass): (k) PVE propagation — recommended mount is a
  raw `lxc.mount.entry … rbind,rslave` (+ `propagation: rslave` on the nested OCI bind),
  making new child datasets appear live without restart; probe verifies, `pct set`
  instructions remain the fallback; (l) FICLONE works through container bind mounts
  (syscall reaches the real fs) — cloning implemented in-process in Go, so busybox `cp`
  is irrelevant; host OpenZFS must have block cloning (2.2+, probed); (m) **`reflink`
  promoted to a first-class backend and the auto-default** wherever the FICLONE probe
  passes (Btrfs/Synology, XFS, hookless ZFS) — `zfs` backend selected only on explicit
  config intent (`storage.zfs.*`), per the Operator's proposal; hardlink-safety matrix
  now applies only where hardlinks are actually used.
- 2026-07-18 (crosscheck v2 adjudication + Operator's passcode correction): **the
  product model is ASSISTED backup** — Operator established that modern iOS demands
  on-device passcode entry for every backup, so unattended backups are impossible;
  auto-retry ladder deleted (failed → `user action required` + one-tap manual retry
  with `retry_of`; run/attempt grouping thereby unnecessary); Shortcut becomes a dumb
  opportunity signal with ALL policy server-side (`/api/automation/backup-opportunity`,
  staleness + cooldown config); v0.1 gate rewritten to a week of real UI-driven Wi-Fi
  backups, qn.12 gate = the assisted acceptance list. Crosscheck v2 refinements
  adopted: zfs `latest/` built from the snapshot's `.zfs` path (snapshot = canonical
  version, latest = materialized view; FICLONE-from-snapshot probed with lock-guarded
  fallback); "self-heals" softened to candidate-plus-verification with
  `repair-working-copy` escape hatch; liveness = activity sampler with staged states
  (`active → silent_but_connected → suspected_stall`) + `waiting_for_passcode` pause;
  **`latest/` is a real directory on all backends, never a symlink** (namespace commit
  = journaled rotation, offsite filter excludes `versions/` too); roll-forward
  principle — post-verify artifacts are never destroyed by recovery, reconciliation
  completes commits instead of unwinding them.
- 2026-07-18 (crosscheck v3 + Operator): (p) **Intent model adopted lightweight** —
  `intent_id` (retry-chain root) + `attempt` on Job; UI groups history by intent
  ("Backup completed after 1 retry"); full server-side Intent entity parked as future
  evolution (Operator liked the concept; ChatGPT itself rated it non-essential for v1).
  (q) **`current/` renamed `working/`** (Operator ruling: names must be readable
  without context — `working`/`latest` self-explains, `current`/`latest` doesn't).
  While renaming, the offsite filter examples were fixed to **anchored** rules — an
  unanchored `**/working/**` exclude would silently drop same-named dirs inside backup
  content (corrupted offsite copy, no error); deploy docs must ship the exact anchored
  filter block.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator concern → process + first gap): (r) **the gap protocol** —
  CLAUDE.md's "everything is decided" softened to canon-so-far; the program doc now
  defines what an agent does at a gap: rung-local → decide in-spec + log (*rung-ruled*);
  architectural → `PROPOSED (gap)` block in the canon doc + open question + STOP for
  Operator ruling; silent deviation and silent doc-vs-reality "fixes" forbidden.
  (s) **first gap processed — backup-encryption management** (Operator-spotted):
  `Device.backup_encryption` from `WillEncrypt`; `POST /api/devices/{udid}/encryption`
  (enable/change_password/disable; passwords via pty or `BACKUP_PASSWORD` env, argv
  forbidden; on-device passcode step narrated); `backup.require_encryption: true`
  policy enforced actionably at preflight; unencrypted devices get a persistent warning
  (no Health/Keychain/passwords) and unencrypted versions carry `encrypted: false`
  badges; one-password-two-uses documented (device backup password == vault unlock
  password; quince sets it, never stores it). Landed in qn.3 scope.
- 2026-07-18 (Operator rulings, product/UX round): (t) **device-centric IA** — one
  primary area (`Devices` + `Settings`); home = Devices dashboard (device cards,
  `Back up now`, inline job progress, N most recent backups across devices — composed
  to look alive for small fleets); backups live inside their device's details page;
  phone-first entry point (PWA opened from a backed-up device lands on that device)
  parked for qn.12. (u) **frontend stack finalized** (revision of D7): Tailwind v4 +
  vendored shadcn-style components on Radix + Zustand + TanStack Query/Virtual; Effector
  dropped and `@mercury-fx/ui` not consumed (Operator wants maximally mainstream,
  maintainable, lightweight, LLM-fluent; mercury stays a taste reference). (v) license
  = MIT. (w) GitHub owner = Operator's personal account (org transfer only on real
  traction); handle pending — later confirmed as `novkostya`. (x) the original codename
  `compote` ruled out as the production name — naming brainstorm opened.
- 2026-07-18 (naming, final): (y) **the project is named `quince`.** Vetted: GitHub
  exact-name sweep (nothing above 31★; runner-ups sunduk/coffret/cargohold recorded in
  chat), npm/PyPI hits are dead micro-packages, Docker Hub clear, no dev-tool product
  conflict (QuinCe the oceanography QC tool is a distinct stylization in a distant
  field; the Quince fashion brand is retail-class — negligible confusion for a free
  self-hosted tool; re-check trademarks properly before any commercialization). All
  docs, rung IDs (`cp.` → `qn.`), env prefixes (`QUINCE_`), snapshot names
  (`@quince-*`), and marker files renamed from the `compote` codename this day.
- 2026-07-18 (post-rename completeness audit, Operator-requested): (z) full doc sweep
  against the conversation's decision history. Fixed: a stale D3 paragraph still
  describing the deleted auto-retry backoff ladder (contradicted D13; replaced with
  assisted-model wording); `reflink` missing from the `Version.backend` enum and two
  "hardlink/copy"-only phrasings; a leftover pre-reflink auto-probe sentence in design
  §5; qn.1 roadmap wrongly including file-watch (staged to qn.6 per D12); lab
  deployment note updated to the `rbind,rslave` recommendation; `dirty-current` →
  `dirty-working` leftovers; stale module-path rename note in qn.0. Gap closed: pair/
  encryption ops returned `op_id` with no way to observe them — added `Op` object,
  `GET /api/ops/{op_id}`, and `op.updated` WS event (the "tap Trust"/"enter passcode"
  narration channel). All other rulings verified present and correctly stated.
- 2026-07-19: (aa) repo root = `~/iphone-backup-app` as-is (git init in place, qn.0);
  the `chatgpt-*.md` planning transcripts and the generated `quince-planning-pack.md`
  stay on disk but are **gitignored** — private lab material never enters the public
  repo; committed transcript fixtures are the durable extract.
- 2026-07-19: (ab) device scope widened in wording (Operator): iPhone AND iPad are
  first-class (same pairing/MobileBackup2 protocol, no extra code); Vision Pro
  untested/unpromised (visionOS may be iCloud-only); Apple Watch out of scope (no
  backup protocol). No iPhone-string-specific code allowed.
- 2026-07-19: (ac) **dev environment ruled** (Operator, after the first qn.0 session
  correctly stopped at the undocumented gap): the driving workstation is a thin client —
  no toolchains or container runtime on it, ever; all gates/builds/pushes run in a
  dedicated `quince-dev` LXC on the Operator's local PVE host (same LAN as the
  test iPhone and the LAN registry); the remote big-iron host is NOT in the dev loop —
  heavy repeatable CI is GitHub Actions. Concrete hosts/addresses/sizing live in
  `local/environment.md` (gitignored Operator-local layer, created this day). Program
  doc gained "Where work runs"; qn.0 gained story 0.
- 2026-07-19: (ad) **public/private doc split** (Operator-spotted: the dev-env edit was
  about to push homelab internals to the public repo): `local/` (gitignored) now holds
  all Operator-specific facts — hosts, LAN addresses, container sizing, lab details;
  public canon states rules generically and references `local/environment.md` by path
  only. Personal identifiers scrubbed from public docs (example device names, private
  design-system paths). Standing rule: hostnames, IPs, topology, and hardware specifics
  never enter committed files.
- 2026-07-19: (ae) **dev box is Alpine + nerdctl via the house template flow** (Operator
  overruling the architect's Debian suggestion; the glibc-for-Playwright concern is
  solved the Alpine way — containerized Playwright runner, or system chromium; qn.1
  verifies and records). Template built by the Operator's template-factory script with
  buildkit enabled (the existing template lacks it); the clone is **resized up front**
  (cores/RAM/swap/rootfs) because template defaults will OOM/ENOSPC on builds — never
  wait for the OOM to size a build box. `TMPDIR` moved off the small tmpfs `/tmp`.
  Multi-arch images stay in GitHub Actions; local builds are amd64-only. Full sequence
  with exact commands: `local/environment.md`.
- 2026-07-19: (af) **the dev host is a container host, not a toolchain host** (Operator
  ruling, superseding the apk-toolchain part of (ae)): no language toolchains install
  on any host, ever — every gate target runs inside a pinned toolchain container
  (nerdctl/docker autodetect in the Makefile), using the same base images as the
  production Dockerfile stages; `versions.env` pins image references in exactly one
  place; named cache volumes keep it fast; Playwright runs in its official image
  (musl question mooted); CI runs the identical containerized `make gates`.
  Contributor requirement collapses to `make` + a container runtime.
- 2026-07-19: (ag) **qn.0 BUILT — the floor stands.** Provisioned `quince-dev`
  on the PVE host per the `local/environment.md` sequence verbatim (Alpine+nerdctl+buildkit
  template → clone → sized → `<lan-ip>`); recorded the exact `pct` commands back into that
  file. Scaffolded `core/` (Go: `serve`+`version`, `/api/health`, `go:embed` UI, slog,
  race-tested), `vault/` (uv `quince-vault` with `selftest` importing
  `iphone_backup_decrypt`), `ui/` (Vite+React+TS+Tailwind v4 sidebar shell, vitest), the
  containerized `Makefile`, multi-stage `deploy/Dockerfile` (netmuxd built from source),
  CI, compose examples, `deploy/dev.md`, transcript-README. **Proven in-container:** full
  `make gates` green, `make image` green, and the image's runtime gates
  (`version`/`health`/`selftest`/embedded-UI) all pass. Rung-ruled bootstrapping fixes
  (in the qn.0 spec + `versions.env`): uv image `-alpine` tag, Tailwind `4.1.18` (4.0.0
  crashes), Rust `1.88` (netmuxd needs edition 2024), pnpm `overrides.vite`, mypy
  stub-override, vault venv built at its final path against the runtime python.
  **`.gitignore` bug caught by testing**: trailing inline comments silently disabled the
  private-file rules — rewritten with column-0 comments; UDID-bearing lab logs now
  verified `!!` ignored. **Registry push proven** (Operator supplied the endpoint): `make
  push REGISTRY=<lan-registry>` pushed `quince:local` to the LAN registry (endpoint in local/environment.md) and it pulls back — closes the old open question 1;
  endpoint recorded in `local/environment.md`. First commit landed (`699c4ef`). One gap
  still open: **stack D2 `PROPOSED`** — the `usbmuxd` daemon is not an Alpine package,
  ruling needed before qn.2. Next frontier: **qn.1** (spec to be written).
